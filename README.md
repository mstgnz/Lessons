# Self-improvement for software developer

The software world is developing rapidly and new technologies are entering our lives every day. We have to learn these technologies as a developer. While learning these technologies, I will also write application codes. I will be doing projects that cover all of these applications, and each of these projects will be uploaded as a separate repo.
